    def process_pdf(self, pdf):
        text = extract_text(pdf)
        images = extract_images(pdf)
        tables = extract_tables(pdf)
        
        # Process each modality
        text_embeddings = embed_text(text)
        image_embeddings = embed_images(images)  # CLIP model
        
        return combined_embeddings
```
