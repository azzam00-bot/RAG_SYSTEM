      "question": "According to the provided text, when factoring a quadratic equation like 2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0, what is the initial consideration for setting up the parentheses?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Finding two numbers that multiply to -4.",
        "B": "Determining the factors for the constant term.",
        "C": "Identifying how the First terms in the parentheses multiply to give 2x^2.",
        "D": "Ensuring the sum of the Outside and Inside products equals -7x."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The text states: When setting up our parentheses, we have to think about how our First terms can multiply together to give us 2. The only way to do this is by 2x and x. This indicates that determining the factors for the x^2 term is the initial step.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Document 2 shows this example: So we set x – 2 and x + 3 equal to zero and solve for x. x – 2 = 0  x + 3= 0  x = 2   x = -3.",
